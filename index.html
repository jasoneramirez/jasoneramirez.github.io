  <p>
    I am a postdoctoral researcher with a background in mathematics, currently
    based in Montréal. I hold undergraduate degrees in Mathematics and Physics,
    as well as an MSc in Mathematics. I completed my PhD in Mathematics at the
    University of Seville, under the co-supervision of Emilio Carrizosa and
    Dolores Romero Morales. During my doctoral training, I was also fortunate
    enough to do research visits at Copenhagen Business School and Cornell Tech.
  </p>

  <p>
    My research initially focused on counterfactual explanations, where I worked
    on extending individual-level explanations to a group-level perspective,
    motivated by a stakeholder’s view. This global perspective enables a more
    insightful understanding of how models behave, including the detection of
    biases and patterns, and led me to explore explanatory approaches beyond
    standard predictive models, such as data envelopment analysis (DEA).
  </p>

  <p>
    More recently, my focus has shifted toward explaining decisions arising from
    data-driven and stochastic optimization models. Rather than explaining only
    predictions or classification outcomes, I am interested in understanding how
    optimization-based decisions are made under uncertainty, including both
    endogenous and exogenous sources of uncertainty.
  </p>

  <p>
    Beyond my research, I care deeply about contributing to the academic
    community. I am a strong advocate of open science, including free and
    open-source code, open-access publications, and transparent research
    practices.
  </p>

  <p>
    Outside academia, I keep my artistic side alive through music. I hold a
    Professional Title in Piano and have completed three years of advanced
    studies. I also enjoy reading and cinema — recommendations and thoughtful
    discussions are always welcome.

      <h2>Teaching</h2>
      <p>
        I have teaching experience in mathematics, optimization, and data science,
        at both undergraduate and graduate levels. My teaching emphasizes
        conceptual understanding, rigor, and the connection between theory
        and real-world applications.
