      <h2>About</h2>
 <p>
    I am a postdoctoral researcher with a background in mathematics, currently
    based in Montréal. I hold undergraduate degrees in Mathematics and Physics,
    as well as an MSc in Mathematics. I completed my PhD in Mathematics at the
    University of Seville, under the co-supervision of Emilio Carrizosa and
    Dolores Romero Morales. During my doctoral training, I also carried out
    research visits at Copenhagen Business School and Cornell Tech.
  </p>

  <p>
    My research began with an interest in counterfactual explanations, where I
    worked on extending individual-level explanations to a group-level
    perspective motivated by a stakeholders' view. Adopting a
    global viewpoint allowed for a more informative analysis of model behavior,
    as well as the identification of biases and recurring patterns. This line of
    work naturally led me to explore explanatory approaches beyond standard
    predictive models, including applications to data envelopment analysis (DEA).
  </p>

  <p>
    More recently, my focus has shifted toward explaining decisions arising from
    data-driven and stochastic optimization models. Rather than limiting
    explanations to predictions or classification outcomes, I am interested in
    understanding how optimization-based decisions are made under uncertainty,
    including both endogenous and exogenous sources of uncertainty.
  </p>

  <p>
    Alongside my research, I value contributing to the academic community and
    promoting open scientific practices. I am a strong advocate of open science,
    including free and open-source code, open access publications, and
    transparent research workflows.
  </p>

  <p>
    Beyond academia, I have always tried to keep space for interests outside
    mathematics. Alongside my scientific training, I pursued formal studies in
    music and hold a Professional Title in Piano, completing three years of
    advanced studies. I am also an enthusiastic reader and cinema lover, and I
    enjoy conversations that challenge ideas and perspectives. Recommendations
    and thoughtful discussions are always welcome!

      <h2>Teaching</h2>
      <p>
        I have teaching experience in mathematics, optimization, and data science,
        at both undergraduate and graduate levels. My teaching emphasizes
        conceptual understanding, rigor, and the connection between theory
        and real-world applications.
