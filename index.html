  <p>
    I am a postdoctoral researcher with a background in mathematics, currently
    based in Montréal. I hold undergraduate degrees in Mathematics and Physics,
    as well as an MSc in Mathematics. I completed my PhD in Mathematics at the
    University of Seville, under the co-supervision of Emilio Carrizosa and
    Dolores Romero Morales. 
  </p>

  <p>
    My research initially focused on counterfactual explanations, where I worked
    on extending individual-level explanations to a group-level perspective,
    motivated by a stakeholder’s view. This global perspective enables a more
    insightful understanding of how models behave, including the detection of
    biases and patterns, and led me to explore interpretability analysis approaches beyond
    standard predictive models, such as data envelopment analysis (DEA).
  </p>

  <p>
    More recently, my focus has shifted toward explaining decisions arising from
    data-driven and stochastic optimization models. Rather than explaining only
    predictions or classification outcomes, I am interested in understanding how
    optimization-based decisions are made under uncertainty, including both
    endogenous and exogenous sources of uncertainty.
  </p>

  <p>
    Outside academia, I keep my artistic side alive through music. I hold a
    Professional Title in Piano and have completed three years of advanced
    studies. I also am an avid reader and lover cinema, recommendations and thoughtful
    discussions are always welcome!

        Mathematical Optimization Modelling for Group Counterfactual Explanations

      This paper introduces a mathematical optimization framework for generating
      counterfactual explanations at the group level. Moving beyond individual
      explanations, we adopt a stakeholder perspective in which counterfactuals
      must be produced jointly under structural and feasibility constraints.
      The resulting models reveal close connections between group counterfactual
      explanations and classical facility location problems.

        Counterfactual Analysis and Target Setting in Benchmarking

    <p class="paper-desc">
      We extend counterfactual reasoning to Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA),
      introducing an optimization-based framework for interpretable target
      setting in efficiency analysis. Counterfactual targets are computed via
      mixed-integer convex optimization, providing transparent and actionable
      explanations for inefficient units in benchmarking applications.

    <p class="paper-desc">
      This work studies collective counterfactual explanations, where 
      explanations are generated for an entire group of individuals at the same time. We formulate
      the problem as a mixed-integer optimization model that minimizes total
      perturbation cost while guaranteeing a favorable classification outcome,
      allowing shared influential features and outliers to be identified
      simultaneously.

      Linear Models and Design of Experiments

      BSc in Mathematics & Mathematics–Statistics (3rd–4th year), University of Seville
    </p>
    <p class="course-desc">
      I taught practical sessions focused on linear regression models and experimental design,
      with an emphasis on implementation and data analysis in <em>R</em>. My teaching approach
      centered on helping students translate theoretical concepts into working statistical models,
      write reproducible code, and critically interpret outputs. Particular attention was given to
      model diagnostics, experimental structure, and the connection between assumptions and results.

    <p class="course-desc">
      I taught both theory and practice in an introductory statistics course for engineering
      students. Alongside foundational topics in descriptive statistics, probability, and inference,
      I introduced students to statistical computing in <em>R</em>, focusing on hands-on data analysis
      and interpretation. The goal was to equip students with practical tools to analyze real data
      and to understand statistical reasoning in applied health and engineering contexts.
